## Below are the five things we accomplish with this analysis:

## 1. Create and Place a README file for this repository.   The README file in the project root directory that includes an explanation of the purpose of the project and the other files

## 2. Load up a data file contining files that clean up the data set.  A data directory containing files to load in and clean up the data. The clean up should include finding out where there are outliers or missing values, deciding how you will treat them, making sure values you think are numerical are being treated as such (correct R class), etc.   
##    The name of the raw and corrected data sets used are below:
##       • Original Dataset:  rollingsales_brooklyn.csv
##       • Cleaned Dataset on data frame bk:  CLEANED_bk_rollsales_brooklyn.csv.  This is the orginal date with the cleaning that we orginally received in the code provided in class.  Filtering data and removing NAs. 
##       • Cleaned Dateset on data frame familydwell using our code:  CLEANED_familydwelling.csv.  This is the CLEANED_rolingsales_brookly.csv with some additional filters for our analysis.  We filter out only One, Two and Three Family Dwelling Homes.  Additional cleaning includes removing zeros in year.built, removing sales purchase data below $500 and other cleaning documented in the HTML file.
    
## 3.  An analysis directory containing a file (or files) for exploratory data analysis on the clean data to visualize the relationship between gross or land square footage and sales price.
##       • File names:  SalesPrice_vs_GrossOrLandSqft_HTML.html, SalesPrice_vs_GrossOrLandSqft_HTML.cmd

## 4.  A paper directory containing a HTML file (plain text or Markdown) that explains any meaningful patterns in this dataset.
##       • File name:  RollHouseSales_NYC_HTML.html, RollHouseSales_NYC_HTML.cmd

## 5. Deliverable: A link to a repository (test-repo is fine) on GitHub containing the above.  Need only one link per group. The repostiory should be able to be shared with others
